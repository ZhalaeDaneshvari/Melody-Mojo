[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 3 Team Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your **team** collectively revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

We fixed the handling of the album cover files to ensure any file upload would work as opposed to just files named after the id number. We also changed the hardcoding of the tags in the filter by aside.


## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)
> If one person did not contribute, simply state that.

We worked together on it by doing a zoom call and then sharing each other's screens, and we collaboraitly figued out how to do the sesisons and access controls. It was completely equal work and was a very helpful and smooth process.
